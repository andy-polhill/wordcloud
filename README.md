##Things I would do with more time
  * ES6 Module loading
  * Template precompilation
  * Find out if there is a way to determine tag location before appending to the DOM
    * This will help with performance and cut down on repaints
  * Deal with collision to container bounds
  * Improve test coverage

_Not currently what I would define as "production ready", but I'm running out of time to burn on it._
